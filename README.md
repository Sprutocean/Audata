# Audata (built on VANA)

# üöÄ WE ARE THE FUEL FOR AUDIO MACHINE LEARNING
Our project leverages Vana technology to create a unique ecosystem where everyone can securely provide the personal audio content staying capable to govern it. We focus on audio files which contain spontaneous speech, represented as audio messages from Telegram and Whatsapp. That is how the system's scalability is easily achieved - by utilizing pre-existing audio data. 

Read below what we build, where it is used, what our tech consists of and how you personally can contribute to the new-born industry of audio data. **(spoiler: there are 10+ ways)**

# üìã PROJECT STRUCTURE
We set up a multi-repo system so you can use any of these pieces in your own project in no time.

How all the elements are connected?
---
1. Telegram Bot - it is the gate any user see first while joining our system. Here we provide friendly guide how to start. 
2. Telegram MiniApp - it is our main hub to welcome new audio contributions. The UI to upload audiofiles and encrypt them, then send to Storj. 
3. Storj - The files are kept encrypted in Storj. We use this type of storage to be able to compute data conviniently. 
4. Proof of Contribution - it is the key element of the system, that is used to prove uloaded audio files have value. 
5. 

How do we prove our audios have real value and uniqness? 
---
For these purposes, we use Satya Proof of Contribution created by VANA.
Here's our modified version of the proof:
Here are VANA's docs for further insights:

We use this validator to check audio files against the following four parameters:

+ **Authenticity**: Ensures that the data is real and unaltered.
+ **Ownership**: Confirms the data belongs to the contributor.
+ **Quality**: Measures the relevance and utility of the data.
+ **Uniqueness**: Prevents redundant or copied data from being reused.

How do we keep in privacy audios' content?
---
For now, we are finishing to build the system to collect and store data in the best format. In the nearest future we will join VANA's Data Access Layer/ (link). 
We are aimed to build the next system: buussnesses can run queries on user's data without exposing the very content of the data. The model is built, the model (the neuronet) 'reads' the content of audio files and then proivide the computed results to its owner. 

How do we keep the control in hands of the user?
---
Right now we are building the UI so anyone can delete the audios that were previously contributed. 


# üñ•Ô∏è USAGE EXAMPLES: How you can use what we do?
Scientific research
---
**The Challenge:**

A team of linguists is researching the evolution of Spanish dialects worldwide. Their goal is to build a sophisticated computational model capable of identifying any dialect represented. Traditional research methods would require contacting and interviewing individuals in numerous communities across all 21 countries, potentially involving hundreds of focus groups to account for regional variations within each country. This is so time and energy and money consuming,

**The Solution:**

Our platform provides the linguists with access to a geographically representative dataset of audio recordings. To gain access, the team needs to propose their research project to the Audata community and garner sufficient support.If approved, they will not spend any extra money and will only pay for clean and ready-to-use data.

AI and neuronets development
---
**The Challenge:**

A game development company needs diverse, high-quality audio data in multiple languages to create more engaging dialogue for the numerous non-player characters (NPCs). Gathering this data traditionally would require the extensive global recruitment and impossible efforts.

**The Solution:**
By simply requesting access to pre-categorized audio pools (segmented by language, age, occupation, etc.), the company can quickly obtain the diverse audio data needed for NPC voice acting. They can create hundreds of small request to pick up only those datasets that they really need for their character portraits.

# üåü FUTURE: What we are planning to do?
Machine Learning Labs
---
In the nearest future we are going to build a platform that will allow any startup to get raw data, process it and get the result with no extra efforts. It is the key element of our project as it is to be a bridge beetween data we collect and the result world gets from it. 

University incubators + hachatons for newcomers. 
---
We are aimed to build or support incubators that are created, run or supported by students. We are focusing on fast-growing academies in fast-developing countries, however, we would love to partner with any academic entity worldwide. The parthnership will include, first of all, our assistance on usage of the infra we built, including Labs you can read about higher. 

Ecosystem Dashboard
---
Dashboard is not only the interface to check your audios uploaded. It is multifunctional hub built to depict the whole dao's landscape.The dashboard will be a heart of Audata, where anyone can see the project growing. And as it will be a heart of our project, we would like to deliver it to other DAOs as well. Publicity and recognition should be based on transparency from the very beginning. Ecosystem contributions - we would like to help other projects depict what they've already done as well. So, if you know how to build best user-friendly dashboards, you are welcome to help us to mass-adopt this aprooach! 


# ü§ù CONTRIBUTING: how you can help us?
First of all, you can contribute to our projects and tools here, on Github. We are tracking the activity around it all the time. 
Secondly, you can apply for a position in our team. If you can do something great for the future of audio science, why not to start right now? 
Thridly, you can start a project based on raw data we collect.
Lastly, you can just contact us to provide any kind of assistance you ar eeager to provide. You are welcome!
