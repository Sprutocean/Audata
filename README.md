# Audata (built on VANA)

# üöÄ WE ARE THE FUEL FOR AUDIO MACHINE LEARNING. 
Our project leverages Vana technology to create a unique ecosystem where everyone can securely provide the personal audio content staying capable to govern it. The project focuses on the system designed to handle audio files which contain spontaneous speech, often represented as audio messages. That is how the system's scalability is easily achieved - by utilizing pre-existing audio data.

Highly active telegram and WhatsApp users can produce hundreds of audio recordings per week. This results in thousands of recordings per user. Just several thousand participants (providers) can create the database of game-changing size: the resulting array could easily reach hundreds of thousands of minutes of audio material. This will already be enough to fuel revolutionary projects of various kinds.

# üìã QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
What exactly do we do?
---

How do we prove our audios have real value and uniqness? 
---
For these purposes, we use Satya Proof of Contribution created by VANA.
Here's our modified version of the proof:
Here are VANA's docs for further insights:

We use this validator to check audio files against the following four parameters:

**Authenticity**: Ensures that the data is real and unaltered.
**Ownership**: Confirms the data belongs to the contributor.
**Quality**: Measures the relevance and utility of the data.
**Uniqueness**: Prevents redundant or copied data from being reused.

How do we keep in privacy audios' content?
---
For now, we are finishing to build the system to collect and store data in the best format. In the nearest future we will join VANA's Data Access Layer/ (link). 
We are aimed to build the next system: buussnesses can run queries on user's data without exposing the very content of the data. The model is built, the model (the neuronet) 'reads' the content of audio files and then proivide the computed results to its owner. 

How do we prepare the data for machine learning purposes?
---
The files are kept encrypted in Storj. 

How do we keep the control in hands of the user?
---
Right now we are building the UI so anyone can delete the audios that were previously contributed. 


# üñ•Ô∏è USAGE EXAMPLES: How you can use what we do?
Scientific research

The Challenge:

A team of linguists is researching the evolution of Spanish dialects worldwide. Their goal is to build a sophisticated computational model capable of identifying any dialect represented. Traditional research methods would require contacting and interviewing individuals in numerous communities across all 21 countries, potentially involving hundreds of focus groups to account for regional variations within each country. This is so time and energy and money consuming,

The Solution:

Our platform provides the linguists with access to a geographically representative dataset of audio recordings. To gain access, the team needs to propose their research project to the v3-Data-DAO community and garner sufficient support.If approved, they will not spend any extra money and will only pay for clean and ready-to-use data.

AI and neuronets development

The Challenge:

A game development company needs diverse, high-quality audio data in multiple languages to create more engaging dialogue for the numerous non-player characters (NPCs). Gathering this data traditionally would require the extensive global recruitment and impossible efforts.

The Solution:
By simply requesting access to pre-categorized audio pools (segmented by language, age, occupation, etc.), the company can quickly obtain the diverse audio data needed for NPC voice acting. They can create hundreds of small request to pick up only those datasets that they really need for their character portraits.

Ecosystem Dashboard
---
Dashboard is not only the interface to check your audios uploaded. It is multifunctional hub built to depict the whole dao's landscape.The dashboard will be a heart of Audata, where anyone can see the project growing. And as it will be a heart of our project, we would like to deliver it to other DAOs as well. Publicity and recognition should be based on transparency from the very beginning. Ecosystem contributions - we would like to help other projects depict what they've already done as well. So, if you know how to build best user-friendly dashboards, you are welcome to help us to mass-adopt this aprooach! 


# ü§ù CONTRIBUTING: how you can help us?
First of all, you can contribute to our projects and tools here, on Github. We are tracking the activity around it aalll the time. 
Secondly, you can apply for a position in our team. If you can do something great for the future of audio science, why not to start right now? 
Thridly, you can start a project based on raw data we collect.
Lastly, you can just contact us to provide any kind of assistance you ar eeager to provide. You are welcome!
