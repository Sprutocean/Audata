# Audata (built on VANA)

# 🚀 WE ARE THE FUEL FOR AUDIO MACHINE LEARNING. 
# What exactly do we do?
Our project leverages Vana technology to create a unique ecosystem where everyone can securely provide the personal audio content staying capable to govern it. The project focuses on the system designed to handle audio files which contain spontaneous speech, often represented as audio messages. That is how the system's scalability is easily achieved - by utilizing pre-existing audio data.

Highly active telegram and WhatsApp users can produce hundreds of audio recordings per week. This results in thousands of recordings per user. Just several thousand participants (providers) can create the database of game-changing size: the resulting array could easily reach hundreds of thousands of minutes of audio material. This will already be enough to fuel revolutionary projects of various kinds.
